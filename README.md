# Final Project

## Basic App Info
- Website name: takeabreak.com
- API used: https://rapidapi.com/LemmoTresto/api/joke3?endpoint=apiendpoint_2b453b32-13e8-4c7b-bbae-ec17b35b9045
- Purpose: A website where people can take a break from work and laugh/relax.

## Functionalities
Users can:
- Get a random joke by clicking the button
- Like or unlike a joke by clicking the appropriate icons
- Read news from The Dodo by clicking on the title of the news box 
    - all news images used are taken from Google Images

Users cannot:
- Submit their own joke, because the API doesn't let them
- Send their suggestions to me 
- But I still did designed forms for these because, based on a Piazza post, it still counts as interactive portion

## Creative Portion
- Designed React app with multiple pages using HashRouter
- Framer Motion library was used for the following animations:
    - Laughing emoji rotates once on page load
    - Buttons/icons get larger and change color on hover
